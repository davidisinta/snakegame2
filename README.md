**Java Snake Game**

The Java Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game inspired by the popular Snake Xenzia. This is the first Java project that allowed me to further develop my Java programming skills while delving into game development.

**Features:**
- Control a snake on the game board using arrow keys.
- Eat apples to increase the snake's size and score.
- Avoid collisions with the game walls and the snake's own body.
